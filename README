Jokebot MP

Description:
A jokebot written for Mongo DB and PHP

Version:
1.0

History:
I like jokes, and I use a lot of command line tools.  I put a few jokes in my scripts, but wouldn't it be nice to pass a -j flag and get a random joke?  I looked around on the internet and didn't find a "joke api", so I decided to make one.  It only took me a couple of hours, with the longest part being formating the jokes for the initial import.

Jokebot can output a random joke in xml, html, plain text, and json format.  For a plain text shell example:

curl http://jokes.tfound.org/jokebot/?format=text

The format parameter can take xml,html,text, or json.  Everything else is ignored.

Requirements:
mongo db 
You need mongo running locally, on default port of 27017.

php 5.3
php pecl mongo driver

Setting up mongo is beyond the scope of this document.

Installation:
* Copy all files into a folder under your webroot, ie:
* Change to that directory
* Run php ./jokebot-init.php .  It dumps some output so you could visit this in a web browser, too, but output is not formatted for html.
* Visit http://yoursite/jokebot/ or run php ./index.php and enjoy a joke.
* Set up your scripts to output a joke

Setup example:

# change to your git export/tarball extract
cd Jokebot-MP
mkdir -p /var/www/html/jokebot
mv ./* /var/www/html/jokebot/
cd /var/www/html/jokebot
php ./jokebot-init.php
# init output
php ./index.php


Shell script example, using curl. save as randomjoke.sh, chmod 755 randomjoke.sh, and run it.

cat >randomjoke.sh<<-EOF

#!/bin/bash
# random joke teller

while getopts "j:" OPTION
do
    case ${OPTION} in
        j)
		curl http://jokes.tfound.org/jokebot/?format=text
		exit 0
		;;
    esac
done
EOF
chmod 755 randomjoke.sh
./randomjoke.sh -j


Enjoy.
