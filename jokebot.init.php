Twas the month after Chanukah, and all through the house 
Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse. 
The cookies I\'d nibble, the latkas I\'d taste 
At Chanukah parties had gone to my waist. 

When I got on the scales there arose such a number! 
When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber). 
I\'d remember the marvelous meals I\'d prepared 
The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared, 

The wine or the egg creams, the bread and the cheese 
and the way I\'d never said, \'\'No thank you, please.\'\' 
As I dressed myself in my husband\'s old shirt 
and prepared once again to do battle with dirt--- 

I said to myself, as only I can 
\'\'You can\'t spend the winter disguised as a man!\'\' 
So... away with the last of the sour cream dip, 
Get rid of all chocolate, each cracker and chip 

Every last bit of food that I like must be banished 
\'\'Till all the additional ounces have vanished. 
I won\'t have a cookie--not even a lick. 
I\'ll want to chew only a long celery stick. 

I won\'t have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie, 
I\'ll munch on a carrot and quietly cry. 
I\'m hungry, I\'m lonesome, and life is a bore--- 
But isn\'t that what January is for? 
Unable to giggle, no longer a riot. 
Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet!', 'n/a', 1075960968, 'T', 'approved');

His brother found out that a red neck was on the jury and figured he would be the one to bribe. He told the red neck that he would be paid $10,000 if he could convince the rest of the jury to reduce the charge to manslaughter. 
The jury was out an entire week and returned with a verdict of manslaughter. 

After the trial, the brother went to the red neck\'s house, told him what a great job he had done and paid him the $10,000. 

The red neck replied that it wasn\'t easy to convince the rest of the jury to change the charge to manslaughter. They all wanted to let him go.

BC recently was faced with a unique problem. 

A number of grade 12 girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. 

Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the next day, the girls would put them back. 

Finally the principal decided that something had to be done. 
She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. 

To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. 

He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it. 

Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror.', 'n/a', 1075964002, 'T', 'approved');

The salesman seemed hurt and then tries again - 
"Sir, since you are a bit irate, I\'ll sell it to you for 1/2 price at $100.00? 

Again, the man replies bluntly - "you must be crazy pal, now go away!" 

The salesman then reaches into his briefcase and pulls out 2 brownies and begins munching away on one of them. He tells the irate guy - 
"Sir, please share one of my brownies since I have annoyed you so much".

"HEY," he snarled, "this brownie tastes like crap!!!"
